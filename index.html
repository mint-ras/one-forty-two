              What is Disruptive Innovation?
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              Disruptive innovation describes a product, service or technology that initially takes root in simple applications at the bottom of a market, and then “relentlessly moves upmarket, eventually displacing established competitors”, according the Christensen Institute. Disruptive innovations make products and services more accessible and affordable, making them available to a larger population. Augmented, virtual, and mixed reality can be considered one of the most disruptive technologies at present.
              <br /><br />
              Augmented, virtual, and mixed reality products are at the forefront of immense and dramatic technological progress. Virtual reality has been described as the most disruptive technology of the next decade by IDTechEX reports because it has already had a major impact in a range of different industries. In its recent market research report, IDTechEx predicts this technology will grow to $8 billion by 2030.
              <br /><br />
              The new capabilities that augmented and virtual reality will usher in the next wave of massive disruption. These capabilities include but are not limited to remote working, digital twins, paperless, environments and hands-free working environments.
              <br /><br />
              High levels of funding and investment were put into virtual, augmented, and mixed reality products during through 2010-2020 and is predicted to continue into the next decade. IDTechEx also forecasts that AR/VR and MR collectively combined will be over $30 billion by 2030. The impact of these technologies will impact a diverse range of industries, from retail, entertainment, education, medicine, and tourism. Virtual reality and augmented reality has been wide-reaching and will continue to be innovate and accelerate innovation in these industries.

              Augmented Reality: World of Extended Reality
              <br />
              By Sr. Mae Yparraguirre
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              Augmented reality is when parts of the users’ physical world is enhanced or extended with the use of computer-generated input. These inputs can be sound, video, graphics, GPS overlays and much more. This digital content then responds in real time to changes in the user’s environment, such as movement. The term “augmented reality” was first used to describe such technology in 1990 by Thomas Caudell.
              <br /> <br />
              Augmented Reality (AR) – Digital elements appear over real-world views, sometimes with limited interaction between them (often via smartphones).
              <br /> <br />
              Virtual Reality (VR) – An immersive experiences that isolates users from the real world (typically using headset devices).
              <br /> <br />
              Mixed Reality (MR) – A combination of AR & VR elements so digital objects can interact with the real world.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="article-content">
              There is a slight overlap regarding interactivity. But in AR, digital elements are merely super-imposed on real world views, not anchored directly to them.

              <b>Retail</b> <br/>
              AR allows users to try on virtually anything in retail from clothes to shoes to glasses to seeing how furniture would look in your home. Some retailers employing AR include Converse, Vyking, Nike, Watchbox, Speqs Eyewear, Warby Parker, IKEA, just to name a few. 72% of customers purchased products they hadn’t planned on after using AR while shopping, according to the study “The Impact of AR on Retail.”
              <br /> <br />
              <b>Construction & Training</b> <br/>
              In construction, AR allows architects, clients, crews, and developers to visualize a design in a space & existing conditions before any construction begins. AR & MR also provide valuable training tools for factory workers & technicians to complete tasks, troubleshoot problems, & digital references.
              <br /> <br />
              <b>Tourism</b> <br/>
              AR can provide a potential traveler with an even more immersive experience from a destination before they travel.
              <br /> <br />
              <b>Education</b> <br/>
              AR can help engage students with dynamic 3D models & benefit visual learners with digital renderings & life-like visualizations.
              <br /> <br />
              <b>Healthcare</b> <br/>
              AR can provide surgeons with digital images & critical information within their field of view during a surgical procedure. Startups are building AR technology to support digital surgery, 3D medical imaging & specific surgeries.
              <br /> <br />
              <b>Transportation/Navigation Systems</b> <br/>
              AR makes it possible for cars to project the outside camera view onto the interior car seats giving the illusion of a transparent car.

              What is VR in Gaming?
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
                Virtual Reality is a Disruptive Technology in the context of both Interactive Multimedia and Gaming. From the limited inputs of standard controllers and audio-visual-only outputs, VR took a step further into a new horizon through meshing well motion-tracked inputs and immersive audio-visual interactive experience.
                <br /> <br />
                VR in Gaming created a more “realistic” experience, bringing games to players by not just simply showing the experience on a monitor but into a space that is parallel to the game. VR systems as of the current release of hardware platforms that are compatible with the Head-mounted display devices, can track head motion, some can track full body motion and location, some can track hand gestures, and others can fully track each finger depending on the included hand controllers.
                <br /> <br />
                Here are the current VR HMD devices available in the market: Oculus VR, PSVR, HTC VIVE, Google Daydream View, Samsung VR

              Components of VR systems
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              VR systems are mainly composed of three parts:
              <br /> <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Stereoscopic Head-mounted Display
              <br /> <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; PC
              <br /> <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; Controllers and Trackers
              <br /> <br />
              Head-mounted Display shows the player the first-person perspective of the game and also tracks the player’s head motion input. PC is required to supply the images although some HMDs do not require a PC and have its own computing device responsible for the image output. Early 2013, VR systems were simply considered as an additional accessory to a PC setup. However, currently, companies are slowly trying to build a parallel platform that could stand on its own which is similar to what Oculus did to their Oculus Quest system.

              History of VR
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              VR history could be traced back to its predecessors in the early 1800s called Stereoscope invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone. It is a device that depicts the left eye and right eye separately through two images creating a three-dimensional viewing illusion.
              <br /> <br />
              In the 1935’s novel Pygmalion’s Spectacles by Stanley G. Weinbaum, readers were introduced with a pair of spectacles that brings the user to a simulated environment.
              <br /> <br />
              In 1956, there were attempts to create a film that puts the viewer in the film; one of them is Sensorama.
              <br /> <br />
              In 1961, Head-mounted displays by Philco Corporation were introduced as a surveillance system and suggested the concept of HMD resolution display matching the eyes’ resolution.
              <br /> <br />
              In 1965, Ivan Sutherland created his “The Ultimate Display” kickstarting interactive computer graphics in Virtual Reality.
              <br /> <br />
              In 1987-1990s, the military such as the British Aerospace saw the potential of VR and adapted the technology for their training simulations. Parallel to that, civilians experienced the surge of VR through arcades and attempts of consoles to create gimmicky accessories such as the Virtual Boy of Nintendo and Atari’s Jaguar VR.
              <br /> <br />
              In 2012, Palmer Luckey took a keen interest in taking the next step to the VR experience, he created a crowdfunding for his creation called Oculus with his 6th-gen unit dubbed “Rift” intended to be as a Do-It-Yourself kit.

              How does VR disrupt the Gaming Industry?
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              According to Christensen’s theory of Disruption, it could be a process where a company with limited resources is able to challenge the established status quo of service or product. It could be considered disruptive if it successfully targets overlooked segments, improves the functionality, and becomes cost-effective.
              <br /> <br />
              In the recent years of VR, it slowly left a mark on the industry’s general market share. Although, there are roughly 200 titles that are on VR or have VR support on Steam and 664 titles on PlayStation VR. VR is at its early stage of “disruptiveness”; it is innovative as it scratches the overlooked itch for complete immersion in games but it does not improve fully the functionality and costing of console/PC gaming. There may be recent improvements in terms of costing and hardware as the current VR kits are now priced at roughly 300 USD but VR is still a niche that is adopted by the early adopters leading to early majority in terms of diffusion of innovation model. In terms of functionality, not all games are compatible to all VR systems and at the same time not all VR systems can run all games.
              <br /> <br />
              In the context of game production, VR has the potential to improve the pipelines of development as it empowers devs helping them create through immersive means. Tools such as Substance Painter, Gravity Sketch, Facebook Quill, Oculus Medium, Tilt Brush by Google, and Mozilla A-Painter are examples of production tools available currently on the VR platform. These are not game engines nor 3D creation tools like Blender, yes, but these are tools that devs could use to conceptualize their characters or even use to add textures. Substance Painter is one of the industry standard tools in creating textures for game assets.

              Are we going to see a  disruptive effect similar to what happened with home consoles and PC against arcades?
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              Simple answer, No.
              <br /> <br />
              At the rate of its development, considering the shift of Oculus VR (one of the early companies that created the modern VR kits) towards non-gaming developments, it would not take over the duopoly between console and PC of the gaming market. However it is possible that it would retain its position as something that coexists with PC and console as a peripheral that enhances the gaming experience.
              <br /> <br />
              According to the Fortune Business Insights, VR in Gaming market size stood at USD 5.12 billion last 2019. By 2027, it is projected to be USD 45.20 billion. This projection is based on the driving factors of gaming systems becoming cheaper at price-performance ratio. It is predicted that the demand for VR would be higher as the new generation of consoles and powerful graphics cards become available. The only restraining factor for this growth is the lack of VR content.

              Virtual Reality in Education
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">
              Virtual Reality in Education has given more opportunities for teaching and learning. Without leaving the classroom, VR allows students to explore and absorb more information. The 3D environment makes learning a more fun and stimulating experience.
              <br/><br/>
              In traditional education, teachings are based on lessons learned, written history and future demands. These are usually laid out in books, ebooks and illustrations which also come in different versions alongside the restrictions of our bare imagination. With Virtual Reality in Education, teachings come to life before any learner’s eyes. Without relying just on textbook descriptions, any student experiences an interactive 3D world where they travel, explore and immerse.
              <br/><br/>
              A breakthrough happened in 2003, an online virtual world called Second Life was launched. However similar it was to massively multiplayer online role-playing games, its creators were emphatic to state it is not a game. It features 3D based user-generated content which targets people aged 16 and over. Education-wise, Second Life is a platform used by over a hundred regions for educators to build lessons and invite students to immerse themselves in a more personal form of distance learning.
              <br/><br/>
              Field trips to Mars were also made possible with the help of Virtual Reality. Geared with transparent 4K displays, switchable glass film and surround sound system, Lockheed Martin transformed a local school bus into the Red Planet. Students were handed VR glasses as they traveled along the streets of Washington DC mapped onto the virtual surface of Mars. This Red Planet experience is only one of the space explorations and science projects Generation Beyond offers on their website for educators who wish to make high school and middle school more immersive and interactive.
              <br/><br/>
              Apart from space exploration, Virtual Reality makes museum visits one click away. Boulevard pioneers in allowing users to tour famous museums, interact with it and learn more about arts and history. To top it all, users are accompanied by well-known authors, artists and curators which in turn increases students’ engagement without even leaving their classroom.
              <br/><br/>

              Labster VR made virtual lab simulations possible for schools and universities. It aims to ensure a safe and interactive environment where students gain more understanding of STEM courses through hundreds of engaging hours of science learning content. Future doctors can visualize how surgery works without any potential risks. There are several simulations available on their website which can run on laptop and desktop computers.
              <br/><br/>
              Gently disrupting, Google Expedition is little by little surpassing conventional classroom settings as it offers virtual field trips anywhere in the world, brings abstract concepts to life and enables teachers or learners their own virtual adventures – all these made possible with a touch on their own smartphone and tablet. A very similar platform that uses Virtual Reality in field trips is Nearpod. It also introduces interactive videos, game-based learnings and quick formative assessments as collaborative work among students and educators.
              <br/><br/>
              These virtual reality inventions are just enough proof that VR isn’t made solely for games and entertainment. The possibility of VR soon replacing textbooks with interactive educational experiences is not a farfetched. Both learners and educators can unlock potential skills through practical experiences in a virtual world. Only time will tell when the whole world will completely turn head to this computer technology and take education on a whole new level.

              Commerce is one of the most necessary innovations that humans have ever created. This is the act of exchange between a seller or producer and buyer or consumer. It offers a substantial amount of economic growth for a country as it not only provides a space for employment, but it also acts as a way to keep the circulation of produce with value, steady.
              <br /> <br />
              There are two currently two branches of this in the modern world. Traditional Commerce and E-Commerce. Traditional Commerce, in its name, refers to the conventional face-to-face trading in a brick and mortar or physical setting. E-Commerce or Electronic Commerce refers to advanced retail conducted within the internet to enhance customer experience and satisfaction through speedy and long-distance transactions.

            <p class="article-content">
              In this subtopic, we will discuss how disruptive technologies affect current world E-Commerce. One of the most prominent growing technologies in the recent years are Virtual Reality(VR) and Augmented Reality(AR). To quickly recap, these types of technologies, though very similar in nature, have different implementations. VR focuses on full immersion of the user within the “virtual” or computer-generated Reality. AR on the other hand creates computer-generated artifacts that are injected or projected in real time on our existing physical plane. Both of these are (in my opinion) one of the most innovative technologies that can be used in so many ways,  including Retail or E-Commerce.
              <br /> <br />
              E-Commerce tackles all types of online transactions and there are six(6) main types:
              <br /> <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;1. B2C (Business-to-Consumer)
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;1. B2B (Business-to-Business)
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;1. C2C (Customer-to-Customer)
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;1. C2B (Customer-to-Business)
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;1. B2A (Business-to-Administration)
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;1. C2A (Customer-to-Administration)
              <br /> <br />
              It is also important to note that each participating body handles their transactions with cost-efficiency. Now, even though we have so many good things to say about E-Commerce, it is still like any other type of business strategy. It needs to be innovated and evolved in ways that the consumers need it to. One of the ways the market can be changed is by a disrupting it with: Virtual Reality.
              <br /> <br />
              This can change how consumers shop, it gives them a new and unique experience that will rattle the current dominating type of E-Commerce that is 2d and on flat surface screens. For example, IKEA is a furniture store that created a VR app that lets the user “physically” inspect their showrooms and even design their own virtual space. This is such a big innovation as it helps save so much in cost because renovating a house is quite expensive and this gives users a chance to achieve their home-renovation visions with 0 risk.

              Augmented Reality in Social Media
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
              Augmented Reality is basically an interactive experience of a concrete, real environment in which certain objects that are part of the world are augmented through the usage of computer-generated perceptual info. Augmented Reality tends to occur across a plethora of sensory modes which can include haptic, olfactory, somatosensory, visual and auditory. (Romano, 2019)
              <br/> <br/>
              As years pass by, AR tech developed to a much bigger platform that shaped the content of our real world. Its impact toward different aspects in our society created a huge change than of before. In our current situation, famous platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram, use this Augmented Reality tech.
              <br/><br/>
              This is an example of AR in social media. The famous dog filter is widely used ever since Snapchat released this filter. From popular to just regular netizens, they used this filter. The question is, how does this work?
              <br/><br/>
              Snapchat uses an active shape model. This is done to locate facial features that require complex calculations in order to apply the filter. Snapchat draws marks to an image and indicates the borders. It creates a 3D mask after locating the marks or points created after Snapchat scanned a face. How does a filter move after certain actions such as opening the mouth and an animated tongue shows out? Snapchat uses an algorithm that soon activates and triggers to pull out the animation after your facial expression. (Le & Arcangel, 2018)
              <br/><br/>
              Snapchat is not the only and widely used social media platform that offers Augmented Reality. A famous game and show, Pokemon, also created its own AR game by the name of Pokemon Go. Pokemon enthusiasts are given a chance to experience being a Pokemon trainer in real life. Pokemons are located in our real-world map, even inside the house. The players are also encouraged to explore in order to encounter a variety of Pokemons that are unavailable in some locations. This may be a game but it can also be considered as a social media platform for you can socialize with other players, even duel them.
              <br/><br/>
              As for Social Media Marketing, Augmented Reality is used to boost businesses and advertisements. Filters may appear to be just a decoration, but some businesses can use it as an advantage to promote their brands. McDonald’s can collaborate to create a filter that turns a human face to a cup of French fries, Taco bell filter that turns faces to tacos, something like that.
              <br/><br/>
              It could also be used to promote and increase impulse buys. These types of buys are the unplanned ones, a very quick decision type of buy. Augmented Reality could create a not-so-interactive but sees something in a real-world setting. Example, if you’re trying out if a bed or sofa could fit in your living space, an image can be used as a filter to see how it would look like if placed in the real-world.

              Industries are looking at technology as the aching extension of ourselves. And when we can’t satisfy an appetite we look for other things. This has been the overarching ‘can’t get enough of’ mantra people should learn to let go. When you simply put a cycle of wants with anything for that matter, there is and always be an end to it, just as ideas come fresh and they also have a season to end.
